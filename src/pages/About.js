                    To provide 5th through 8th grade girls with an informal, hands-on experience
                    with careers that utilize science, technology, engineering and math. To provide
                    an opportunity to meet and form personal contacts with women in these exciting
                    careers.<br/><br/>

                    GE is a super fun Saturday of science, math, engineering, art, and technology for
                    5th-8th grade girls, put on by women STEM professionals.<br/><br/>

                    Walla Walla Great Explorations is a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
                    Math, plus Arts) event held at Whitman College.  Every other year on the first
                    Saturday of Whitman Collegeâ€™s spring break, 450 5th-8th grade girls attend three
                    workshops and a keynote talk.  The event is all female, from the attendees to the
                    workshop presenters to the keynote and volunteers.  Organized by the non-profit
                    Great Explorations in Education and supported by AAUW (the American Association
                    of University Women), girls are introduced to women role models in STEM careers
                    by participating in hands-on workshops.  Our goal is to encourage greater
                    participation in the science and math education in their middle and high school
                    years that will open the door to opportunities they might have otherwise been
                    unaware of or lacking the enthusiasm and confidence to pursue.  <br/><br/>

                    This event was first held in 1984, and was called Expanding Your Horizons. That
                    first year about 50 girls were welcomed to Whitman College. <br/><br/>
